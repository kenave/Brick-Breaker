# Brick Breaker

## General Info and Demo

This is a simple Brick Breaker clone written in object-oriented, vanilla JavaScript. It has a small twist whereby the ball cannot hit any of the four walls. In order to facilitate this, the player controls four paddles at once, one in front of each wall. Parallel paddles are linked, so the player controls the top and bottom paddles at the same time with the left and right arrow keys. Conversely, the left and right paddles are controlled with the up and down arrow keys. This provides an interesting and challenging twist on the original Brick Breaker concept.

Here is a [video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA5K1tV0JIc) of the game being played.
